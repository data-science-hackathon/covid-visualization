                <p>The pandemic caused by COVID-19 is the first global public health crisis of the 21st century. In
                    December 2019, reports emerged that a coronavirus that specialists had never before seen in
                    humans had begun to spread among the population of Wuhan, a large city in the Chinese province
                    of Hubei. Since then, the virus has spread to other countries, inside and outside of Asia,
                    leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare this as a pandemic.</p>

                        the
                        world, began when the number of cases were relatively low. As can be seen from the Radar chart,
                        India placed heavy restrictions on most of the indications. Heavy requirements on “Stay At Home”
                        orders and “School Closing” and “Restrictions on Gatherings” have allowed India to initially
                        control
                        the number of new cases being added each day. However, with the recent relaxations on on June
                        10th,
                        the number of new cases (and deaths) still continues to rise.

                    <h5>While India decided to impose heavy restrictions, Sweden was on the opposite end of the
                        spectrum. Sweden only imposed heavy restrictions on limiting gatherings. As can be seen from the
                        radar chart, Sweden imposed no restrictions on Stay at Home Requirements. Its residents were
                        allowed more freedom. With relatively few restrictions, Sweden has been able to control and
                        limit the number of daily cases and deaths to a low number, with a max of 2000 new cases.

                        to an extremely low number of cases on a daily basis. New Zealand's policies seem only slightly
                        more restrictive than Sweden's policies. From the comparison of the Radar Charts of these two
                        countries, it seems as though they had very similar models. New Zealand's highest number of
                        cases in a day max out at 95 cases. Since then New Zealand has been able to reduce the number of
                        cases by keeping policies stringent and only relaxing them once the government deemed it was
                        safe to do so.

                    compared to New Zealand and Sweden, but still has been unsuccessful in controlling the number of
                    cases. On April 26th the US recorded a max of around 49000 new cases. Even though this could be a
                    false peak, the number of new cases seems to hover around, for the month of June, 20000 new cases
                    daily. This is all happening while the government is starting to open the country.

                    <h5 class='text-muted'>With the implementation of some policies some countries have succeeded to almost eradicate COVID
                        from its territory, while others continue to struggle with no end in sight. The analysis of the
                        policies reveals that there is no one model that will always be effective to control the outbreak.
                        However, one effective policy found was the use of Contact Tracing to prevent the spread of the
                        disease. Since the United States has focused less on contact tracing, the number of cases still
                        continues to rise.

                    <h5>From the dashboard, it can be seen that the number of people present in parks have increased,
                        which could be contributing to the number of new cases being found each day. This mobility
                        continues to rise in certain public regions of Parks & Beaches (as latest as June 10) that
                        positions a rising concern for the coming weeks.

                        The viewer is taken through various perspectives with a holistic approach to
                        each component of this analysis. Each factor contributing to the spread of a pandemic should be given thorough
                        consideration. Governments should appropriately enforce optimal measures to address
                        these various factors and we should be cooperative to ensure proper enforcement. 
                        This leaves the world better prepared for the future.
