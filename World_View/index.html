                    humans had begun to spread among the population of Wuhan, a large city in the Chinese province
                    of Hubei. Since then, the virus has spread to other countries, inside and outside of Asia,
                    leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare this as a pandemic.</p>

                    <h5>India’s lockdown of 1.3 billion people, the world’s largest and one of the most stringent one in
                        the
                        world, began when the number of cases were relatively low. As can be seen from the Radar chart,
                        India placed heavy restrictions on most of the indications. Heavy requirements on “Stay At Home”
                        orders and “School Closing” and “Restrictions on Gatherings” have allowed India to initially
                        control
                        the number of new cases being added each day. However, with the recent relaxations on on June
                        10th,
                        the number of new cases (and deaths) still continues to rise.

                        spectrum. Sweden only imposed heavy restrictions on limiting gatherings. As can be seen from the
                        radar chart, Sweden imposed no restrictions on Stay at Home Requirements. Its residents were
                        allowed more freedom. With relatively few restrictions, Sweden has been able to control and
                        limit the number of daily cases and deaths to a low number, with a max of 2000 new cases.

                        to an extremely low number of cases on a daily basis. New Zealand's policies seem only slightly
                        more restrictive than Sweden's policies. From the comparison of the Radar Charts of these two
                        countries, it seems as though they had very similar models. New Zealand's highest number of
                        cases in a day max out at 95 cases. Since then New Zealand has been able to reduce the number of
                        cases by keeping policies stringent and only relaxing them once the government deemed it was
                        safe to do so.

                    compared to New Zealand and Sweden, but still has been unsuccessful in controlling the number of
                    cases. On April 26th the US recorded a max of around 49000 new cases. Even though this could be a
                    false peak, the number of new cases seems to hover around, for the month of June, 20000 new cases
                    daily. This is all happening while the government is starting to open the country.
